# Robot Revolution

Welcome to Robot Revolution on Exercism's Julia Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

What is "Linear Algebra"?

There are plenty of technical definitions, on [Wikipedia][linalg-wiki], in textbooks and on excellent websites such as [3Blue1Brown][3blue1brown], but for our purposes we can be more informal.

~~~~exercism/note
Linear Algebra is about lots of interesting (and very useful) things you can do with Vectors and Matrices.
~~~~

The Julia (and Python) maintainers love this sort of thing.
Exercism management, _not so much_.

This Concept will be restricted to the simpler aspects of a huge subject, but be warned: _this is, inevitably, quite a mathematical concept_.

## What is a Vector?

It depends who you ask, and how you want to visualize something rather abstract.

- In Julia, `Vector{T}` is just an alias for `Array{T, 1}`, and the `eltype` `T` can be anything.
- In (much of) Physics, a vector is an arrow with a `length` and `direction` in N-dimensional space, but no fixed position.
- In Linear Algebra, the physicists' arrow is fixed in space, with its tail at the origin. This makes the shaft of the arrow redundant, so we can represent the vector as a `point` in N-dimensional space, with the `N` elements representing distance from the origin along each of the `N` axes.

For present purposes, ignore vectors of strings or characters.
We will be working with numerical types in this Concept: `Int`, `Float`, or `Complex`.

## What is a matrix?

Again, you will find a variety of answers.

- A rectangular 2-D array of numbers _(with no ragged edges)_. A square matrix is a common special case.
- A `linear combination` of column vectors, stacked side by side.
- A `transformation` that can be applied to a vector, just as a `function` is applied to other input types.

Some types of square matrix are common enough to have special names.

***Diagonal matrix:*** All non-zero entries are on the `main diagonal` (top-left to bottom-right).

```julia-repl
julia> [1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3]
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  0  0
 0  2  0
 0  0  3

# a convenient shortcut
julia> diagm(1:3)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  0  0
 0  2  0
 0  0  3
```

***Identity matrix:*** A diagonal matrix with only ones on the diagonal (for reasons that will become clearer later).
Often abbreviated as `I`.

```julia-repl
julia> Matrix{Float64}(I, 3, 3)
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0
```

***Upper triangular:*** Non-zero values on and above the diagonal, zeros below.
***Lower triangular*** you can guess.

## Transposing a matrix

If you really want to swap rows with columns, the function `permutedims()` will do this and give you a new matrix.

This involves copying, which is slow and memory-hungry when working with large matrices.

For Linear Algebra purposes, the `transpose()` function is more useful, as it quickly creates a lazy wrapper around the original matrix.

Even more useful is the `adjoint()` function, which also flips the sign of the imaginary part in any complex numbers.
This operation is common enough that we can just add an apostrophe `'` to the variable name to create the adjoint.

```julia-repl
julia> m
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

# new, full copy
julia> permutedims(m)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6

# lazy version
julia> transpose(m)
3×2 transpose(::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6

julia> mc = [1+2im 2+3im; 3+2im 1+2im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+2im  2+3im
 3+2im  1+2im

# lazy conjugate transpose
julia> adjoint(mc)
2×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1-2im  3-2im
 2-3im  1-2im

# syntactic sugar for adjoint
julia> mc'
2×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1-2im  3-2im
 2-3im  1-2im
```

## Multiplication

The rest of this document includes functionality from the `LinearAlgebra` module.
A `using LinearAlgebra` line will bring it into the namespace, but we will not keep repeating this in the examples (_too much visual clutter_).

### Vectors, element-wise product

This was discussed in the [Vector Operations][vector-ops] Concept.
The operator is `.*`, which operates on the input vectors pair-wise, giving an output the same size and type as the inputs.

```julia-repl
julia> [1, 2] .* [3, 4]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 8
```

### Vectors, dot product

This extremely common operation is written in textbooks as `u ⋅ v`, and called the "dot" product.

A dot product is equivalent to the _sum_ of the element-wise product.

Two vectors can be multiplied with the usual `*` operator, but only if the left vector is an `adjoint`: conveniently written `u' * v`.
This should become clearer in the later section on matrix multiplication.

The raised (_center_) dot is available in Julia (entered `\cdot` tab) as syntactic sugar for the `dot()` function.
There is no need to specify the adjoint, as this detail is handled automatically.

```julia-repl
julia> using LinearAlgebra

# with element-wise syntax
julia> sum([1, 2] .* [3, 4])
11

# with u' * v syntax
julia> [1, 2]' * [3, 4]
11

# with dot()
julia> dot([1, 2], [3, 4])
11

# with \cdot syntax
julia> [1, 2] ⋅ [3, 4]
11
```

For complex-valued vectors, the left vector needs to be the conjugate (sign flipped on the imaginary part).
The `dot` function does this automatically, the `u'` syntax does it explicitly, but `sum(u .* v)` will fail if `u` and `v` are complex.

### Norms

_How "big" is a vector?_

The `norm` is an attempt to capture this, by reducing the vector to an appropriate scalar.

A whole family of norms are defined, but by far the most common is the 2-norm, which is `√(v ⋅ v)`.

This root-mean-square operation is the _Pythagorean distance_ from the origin (in N-dimensional space).
If we visualize the vector as an arrow, with its tail at the origin, the 2-norm is the _length_ of the arrow.

Any p-norm can be calculated by providing `p` as the 2nd argument.
The 1-norm is sometimes useful: it is simply the sum of the absolute values of the entries (so very quick and easy to calculate).

```julia-repl
# defaults to the 2-norm
julia> norm([1, 2, 3])
3.7416573867739413
# the 1-norm
julia> norm([1, -2, 3], 1)
6.0
```

### Matrix multiplication

It sometimes seems as though every applied mathematician in the world has spent much of the last 80 years turning every calculation into a series of matrix multiplications.

This is an operation that computers are very good at:

- It is highly repetitive.
- It can be parallelized efficiently.
- A lot of specialized hardware has been developed to make it faster, including the GPU that is probably integrated into your laptop.

The details are fairly simple, though not very intuitive at first sight.

Consider a matrix `A` multiplying a vector `v` to give an output `w` (_by Linear algebra convention, we will uses uppercase letters for matrices, lowercase for vectors_).

The top row of `A` is dotted with `v` to get the first element of `w`, the second row gives the second element, and so on down.

```julia-repl
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
julia> v = [5, 6]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
julia> A * v
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 17  # equals [1, 2] ⋅ [5, 6]
 39  # equals [3, 4] ⋅ [5, 6]
```

A matrix * matrix multiplication extends this across the columns of the matrix on the right.

For `C = A * B`, we can consider that `A` multiplies each column of `B` to give the corresponding column of `C`: a series of matrix-vector multiplications.

Equivalently, we could say that the first row of `A` is dotted with each column of `B` to give the top row of `C`, the second row gives the second row, and so on down.

```julia-repl
julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [5 7; 6 8]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 5  7
 6  8

# left column is the same as A*v previously
julia> A * B
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 17  23
 39  53

julia> B * A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 26  38
 30  44
```

As shown in the example above, matrix multiplication _does not commute_: there is no simple relationship between `A*B` and `B*A`.

Matrix multiplication is probably hard to visualize for anyone new to it, just by reading the words.
YouTube has lots of videos demonstrating it graphically, so search for "matrix multiplication" and choose one with your preferred style, detail level and language.

### Dimensions

The dot product of two vectors relies on them having equal length.

By extension, for matrix multiplication the _number of columns_ of the left matrix must match the _number of rows_ of the right matrix.

Expressing the sizes as `(nrows, ncols)` tuples, as output by `size(A)`, we have `(a, b) * (b, c) -> (a, c)`.
The "inner" dimensions, here `b` and `b`, are compatible with taking dot products.
The "outer" dimensions, here `a` and `c`, determine the dimensions of the output.

An example with rectangular matrices:

```julia-repl
julia> D = reshape(1:6, 2, 3)
2×3 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 2, 3) with eltype Int64:
 1  3  5
 2  4  6

julia> E = reshape(1:12, 3, 4)
3×4 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 3, 4) with eltype Int64:
 1  4  7  10
 2  5  8  11
 3  6  9  12

julia> D * E
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 22  49   76  103
 28  64  100  136

# (3, 4) * (2, 3) not possible
julia> E * D
ERROR: DimensionMismatch: matrix A has axes (Base.OneTo(3),Base.OneTo(4)), matrix B has axes (Base.OneTo(2),Base.OneTo(3))
```

Multiplying pairs of vectors, matrix-style, has two possibilities.

Conventionally, we would use `u' * v` as an equivalent to the dot product.
The dimensions are `(1, 3) * (3, 1)`, and Julia simplifies the `(1, 1)` output to a scalar (unlike, for example, R).

Alternatively, we could use `u * v'`, with dimensions `(3, 1) * (1, 3) -> (3, 3)`, to multiply all possible pairs of elements and expand the vectors to a matrix.

```julia-repl
julia> u = [1, 2]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
julia> v = [3, 4]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 4
julia> u' * v
11
julia> u * v'
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  4
 6  8
```

`u' * v` is sometimes called the _inner product_.

### Rotations

One particularly common type of matrix multiplication involves rotation matrices.

In 2D, there is a relatively simple matrix to rotate a vector anti-clockwise by `θ` radians.

```julia-repl
julia> rot2d(θ, vec) = [cos(θ) -sin(θ); sin(θ) cos(θ)] * vec
rot2d (generic function with 1 method)

# unit vector in the x direction
julia> i_hat = [1, 0]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0

# rotate 45 degrees
julia> rot2d(π/4, i_hat)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.7071067811865476
 0.7071067811865475

# rotate 90 degrees -> unit vector in the y direction, j_hat
julia> rot2d(π/2, i_hat)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 6.123233995736766e-17  # zero, within numerical error
 1.0
```

## Instructions

You are working for a robotics startup which is developing a simple robot as a proof-of-concept.
You have been tasked with providing some functionality to control the motion of the robot.

## 1. Orient the Robot

To keep track of the robot's orientation and extension, it has three markers which are 1 unit of distance from its center.
To initialize its position, we need to take the three directional vectors, normalize them, and put them in a matrix.

Implement the `orientrobot(vectors)` function, which takes a vector of three vectors.
Return a `2x3` matrix with the normalized vectors as columns.

```julia-repl
julia> orientrobot([[-1,1],[1,0],[-1,-1]])
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.707107  1.0  -0.707107
  0.707107  0.0  -0.707107
```

## 2. Rotate the Robot

Next, we need functionality on how to change the direction of motion.
To do this, we need to rotate the robot to face where it wants to go.

Implement the `rotaterobot(orientation, θ)` function, which takes the robot's orientation matrix and an angle `θ` to rotate *counterclockwise* around.
Return the new orientation matrix.

```julia-repl
julia> orientmatrix = initialize([[-1,1],[1,0],[-1,-1]]);

julia> rotaterobot(orientmatrix, π/2)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.707107  6.12323e-17   0.707107
 -0.707107  1.0          -0.707107
```

## 3. Check for Correct Orientation

To move the robot from one location to another, first we have to check it has the right orientation before moving it.
The second column of the orientation matrix represents the forward facing direction.

Implement the `robotoriented(orientation, direction)` function, which takes an orientation matrix and a relative position vector.
Return `true` if the robot is oriented in the same direction as the relative position vector (within rounding error).

```julia-repl
julia> orientmatrix = initialize([[-1,1],[1,0],[-1,-1]]);

julia> robotoriented(orientmatrix, [5, 0])
true

julia> robotoriented(orientmatrix, [0, 5])
false

julia> robotoriented(orientmatrix, [-5, 0])
false
```

## 4. Robot Body Coordinates

Since the orientation matrix also keeps track of the shape of the robot, we need to know where these points are in reference to the origin after moving the robot.
This will help the robot avoid collisions with other objects when moving around.

Implement the `bodylocation(orientation, position)` function, which takes an orientation matrix and the current position of the center of the robot.
Return the translated orientation matrix.

```julia-repl
julia> orientmatrix = initialize([[-1,1],[1,0],[-1,-1]]);

julia> bodylocation(orientmatrix, [5, 3])
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 4.29289  6.0  4.29289
 3.70711  3.0  2.29289
```

## Hints

### 1. Orient the Robot
- The order in which you perform the operations is important.
- There are several ways to convert a vector of vectors into a matrix.
- Some ideas which can help with making the matrix: comprehensions, for loops, [`hcat`][hcat-ref], [`reshape`][reshape-ref], [`stack`][stack-ref], etc...

### 2. Rotate the Robot
- See Introduction for how to rotate a matrix.
- Simple matrix multiplication is all that is needed.

### 3. Check for Correct Orientation
- Remember, it is the *second* column of the matrix which indicates orientation.
- This can be checked with a dot product.
- It might be helpful to normalize the vectors.
- In case of floating point discrepancies, the orientation only needs to be [approximately][isapprox-ref] equal to around `~1e-7`.
- The following identity could be helpful: `x⋅y = ||x||*||y||cos(θ)` where [`||x|| = norm(x)`][norm-ref]

### 4. Robot Body Coordinates
- This is very straightforward, but elementwise operations are important.
- Remember the orientation matrix can be seen as three position vectors from the origin.
